## Overall Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | Complete | Dual-database strategy and phased rollout are documented |
| Project scaffold | Complete | `backend/` Fastify + TypeScript strict service with health, CI, Docker |
| Supabase schema | Implemented | Migrations 0001-0011 applied on live Supabase; drivers & vehicles dropped |
| Fare engine | Complete | Pure engine ported with unit tests; customer vehicle tiers preserved |
| Booking flow | Complete | Draft booking, `AGR-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`, immutable fare snapshot, masked retrieval |
| Razorpay integration | Implemented (sandbox) | Provider-neutral checkout, HMAC webhooks, idempotency, amount/currency checks |
| Admin operations | Implemented | Booking listing, filters, refunds, audit log (purged driver/vehicle fleet models) |
| Catalog / reviews | Implemented | Draft/publish/archive, moderated reviews, unpublished content hidden |
| MongoDB optional workloads | Deferred | Location cache and raw webhooks live in PostgreSQL/memory for Phase 1 |
| Notifications | Implemented | Queued WhatsApp/email with dedupe; no-op adapters when credentials absent |
| Production deployment | Not started | Hosting, live webhooks, monitoring, and rollback still required |

## Current Milestone

**Milestone:** Clean booking & fare calculation backend without drivers/vehicles management.  
**Completion target:** Verified on live Supabase & MongoDB; all 6 test suites (31 tests) passing; 0 lint/build errors.

## Completed

- [x] Defined Supabase PostgreSQL as the financial and operational system of record.
- [x] Defined MongoDB Atlas as the high-throughput telemetry and document store for the scale phase.
- [x] Specified the Razorpay advance, webhook, signature, and idempotency rules.
- [x] Documented public, operations, and driver API routes.
- [x] Created phase, plan, bug register, API, model, and system-flow documents.
- [x] Initialize the `backend/` repository structure.
- [x] Add environment validation and health endpoints.
- [x] Create and apply Supabase migrations (SQL committed; apply with `npm run migrate`).
- [x] Port and test the fare engine.
- [x] Implement booking draft and ticket generation.
- [x] Implement Razorpay test-mode order and webhook flows (HMAC adapters + contract tests).
- [x] Add contract tests for routes and state transitions.
- [x] Provision live Supabase instance, applied all 10 SQL migrations, and seeded catalog.
- [x] Applied migration `0011_drop_vehicles_and_drivers.sql` to live Supabase DB; dropped tables `drivers` & `vehicles`.
- [x] Purged all driver and physical vehicle models, repositories, and state transitions from backend codebase.
- [x] Dissolved `dispatch/` module into `admin/` module (`GET /api/v1/ops/admin/bookings` and `POST /api/v1/ops/admin/refunds`).
- [x] Verified full build, typecheck, lint, and test suite pass (31/31 tests passing).

## Next Actions

- [ ] Apply `0023_add_canonical_booking_selection.sql` through the staged release; this task did not apply it to live Supabase.
- [ ] Run Razorpay/PayPal sandbox drills against a public HTTPS webhook.
- [ ] Review remaining critical items in [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) with staging evidence.
- [ ] Deploy Mumbai-region API host and production webhook endpoints after sandbox sign-off.

## Change Log

| Date | Change | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-13 | Created the documentation baseline from the master architecture plan | Manus AI |
| 2026-09-14 | Implemented `backend/` service: fare engine, bookings, payments, dispatch, catalog, reviews, tests | Arena Agent |
| 2026-09-14 | Connected live Supabase PostgreSQL & MongoDB Atlas, applied all 10 migrations, and seeded base data | Antigravity AI |
| 2026-09-14 | Purged drivers & vehicles from database and backend codebase per client instructions; 100% test pass | Antigravity AI |
| 2026-09-15 | Phase H1: Added HTTP/3 Alt-Svc, Timing-Allow-Origin, Link preload headers, verification suite | Antigravity AI |
| 2026-09-15 | Phase H2: Applied migration 0012 (partial/covering/trigram indexes), added poolConfig for PgBouncer port 6543, ConcurrencyError optimistic locking & row locks | Antigravity AI |
| 2026-09-27 | Live catalog: migration 0018 (type → text + trip commercial fields + inline media), public `GET /api/v1/catalog` (+type/tripType filters), `GET /api/v1/media/:id` immutable serve, `GET /api/v1/fleet`; admin CRUD for name/price/distance/availability/stops/tripType; gallery policy (place = multi-image, others = 1 cover) enforced server-side; audit logging on catalog update + media delete; 6 new integration tests (67 total green) | Arena Agent |
| 2026-09-27 | Fleet-first booking flow: 4-step wizard (Vehicle → **Choose Trip** → Booking Form → Confirmation). New step lists ALL trips (live catalog + curated fallback, deduped by slug) with search bar, trip-type filter chips, live availability badges ("Only N left" / "On request") and per-vehicle pricing. Fleet/Vehicle-detail "Book" CTAs land directly on trip selection (`?vehicle=…&step=2`). **SK Concierge** booking agent (BookingAssistant) guides each step, offers quick picks (Most booked / Family / Best value / Sunrise), and hands off to the WhatsApp desk with trip+vehicle+date prefilled. Submit now registers a real desk draft booking (`POST /api/v1/bookings/draft`) and shows the desk ticket ID on the voucher, with graceful local-reference fallback. Voucher gains a "Booked Trip" row. | Arena Agent |
| 2026-09-27 | **Re-integrated onto main's F1–F5 batch** (server-authoritative fares, booking rewrite, 982-route manifest): merged origin/main resolving 9 conflicts — backend catalog keeps the live-trip CMS CRUD + media policy AND gains main's manifest/status/republish routes with bumpManifest hooks; fares keep public `/api/v1/fleet` and adopt the F1/F2 engine with catalogue-derived distance; admin CatalogPage keeps full-trip CRUD and grafts main's "Republish site data" control + manifest strip. Booking flow re-mounted on main's architecture: **no client fare arithmetic (F3 rule)** — the trip-selection step now configures the booking engine (mode/package/route) and displays the desk's server quote (total + advance token); step map is 1 route & vehicle, 2 choose trip, 3 guest details & fare review, 4 voucher. SK Concierge feeds on serverFare numbers. Fleet/vehicle-detail CTAs (`&step=2`) land on the trip step. Full verify green: 90 backend tests (13 files), 3 builds + SSG 37 pages; live E2E verified manifest (964 routes), CMS catalog, fare quotes (local ₹2850/₹800; one-way Delhi→Agra sedan ₹2200/165 km), draft ticket AGR-20260927-0869, and admin republish (v4, 8 packages). | Arena Agent |
| 2026-09-27 | **Phase 1: Production Security & Integrity Controls**: (1.1) Mandatory Razorpay production credentials & adapter prohibition; (1.2) Public media visibility checks (SEC-004); (1.3) Active DB fare engine overrides & package sync; (1.4) Unique-active fare rule partial index & transactional activation; (1.5) Full booking & payment lifecycle integration test suite; (1.6) Device token registration ownership lockdown (SEC-005); (1.7) Pre-deploy migrations in Render release phase + Docker entrypoint; (1.8) Deployment readiness health check (`/ready`) returning 503 on DB degradation. | Antigravity AI |
| 2026-09-27 | **Phase 2: Source-of-Truth Convergence & Dynamic Catalog Manifest**: (2.1–2.4) Manifest compiler excludes draft/archived routes; published DB routes override baseline corridors; packages load real published media cover images; (2.5–2.6) Client bounded cache envelope with 10-minute TTL, conditional ETag validation (`If-None-Match`), HTTP 304 handling, and stale status indicator; (2.7) Manifest route prioritized over static route in `App.tsx`. | Antigravity AI |
| 2026-09-27 | **Phase 3 — Step 3.1: Secure LocationIQ Proxy & Caching**: Server-held secret architecture via `/api/v1/locations/autocomplete`, rate limits (60/min), input/output sanitization & bounds (8 items, 200 char max), 30-day locationCache TTL in PostgreSQL/memory, graceful static catalog fallback, client hook dual envelope parser, unit test suite (5/5 passing). | Antigravity AI |
| 2026-10-04 | Canonical booking-selection integrity: additive migration `0023` (pending deployment), nullable route-only fields, authoritative typed selection through quotes/bookings, safe own-profile endpoint, customer/admin type-aware summaries, and end-to-end coverage. Root `npm run verify` passed; no live data or schema was changed. | Manus AI |
