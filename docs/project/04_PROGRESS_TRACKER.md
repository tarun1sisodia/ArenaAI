# Progress Tracker — SK Baghel Tour & Travels

This file is a **living document**. Whoever implements a step updates it after that
step, per `react/docs/01_AI_OPERATING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` §3. Never rewrite history:
check boxes, append log rows, and update the Current State block.

The verbatim per-step log for the original static site and the React migration
(phases 1–32 and R3.5–R7) is preserved in git history — see the previous version of
this file at commit `2c02ee3`. The table below is the condensed record.

---

## Current State

- **Current Phase:** Phase 6 — Frontend Dossier Resolution & Pages complete; ready for Phase 7 cleanup.
- **Current Step:** Phase 6 verified green (ServerApp resolvers, DossierTourPackagePage, TransferDetailPage, LocalPackageDetailPage, MonumentDetailPage, price-led SEO, raw HTML verified, all rows reverted to draft).
- **Last updated:** 2026-10-04
- **Summary:** All HTML designs from `react/new_design/` are completely converted into the React application with ultra-luxury aesthetic styling, design tokens (`theme.css`), and the strict English-only mandate:
  * Multi-Agent Orchestration Engine (`agents/`): Automated agent pipeline with `code_extractor.py`, dynamic language templates (`task_template.py`), `tenacity` exponential retry logic, and specialized agents (`schema_agent.py`, `service_agent.py`, `frontend_agent.py`, `test_agent.py`, `seo_content_agent.py`, `orchestrator.py`).
  * Commercial Exception Rules & Strategy Pattern (`backend/src/modules/fares/fare.strategy.ts`): Implemented strict commercial booking rules for group vehicles ("Urbania", "Force Tempo", and any "Force" variants): forced round-trip billing (`km * 2`), 300 km/day minimum distance floor (`Math.max(km * 2, 300 * days)`), ₹500/day driver allowance, and locked fixed-rate pricing structure (zero promo discounts).
  * Hybrid SSG + In-Memory Route Architecture (M16/M17): High-throughput, 0ms latency route calculation across 982 outstation corridors. Manifest builder (`build-manifest.ts`) extracts CSV into an 11.9KB gzipped dictionary (`public/routes-manifest.json`) correctly parsing per-km group rates (`ft: 17, fu: 25`). `InstantRouteCalculator.tsx` upgraded with 6 vehicle tiers (`sedan`, `ertiga`, `innova`, `tempo`, `urbania`, `hatchback`), `calcGroupVehicle` logic, and transparent breakdown tooltip. `RoutesPage.tsx` updated with 5-column fare grid.
  * Hyper-Scale H1 Network Test Fix: Resolved failing `verify-t1-headers.mjs` by aligning pre-rendered page checks with the English-only route structure.
  * Master Design & Tokens: `@tailwindcss/vite`, `EB Garamond` + `Plus Jakarta Sans`, Material Symbols Outlined.
  * Reusable Editorial Typography & Button System: `react/src/components/layout/EditorialPageTemplate.tsx` providing standard font sizes & colors (`EDITORIAL_TYPOGRAPHY`), standard button sizes & colors (`EDITORIAL_BUTTONS`), and reusable action components (`PrimaryButton`, `WhatsAppButton` with guaranteed `#ffffff` text & icon, `SecondaryButton`, `EditorialPill`) matching the approved homepage standards without altering page layouts.
  * Global Chrome: Luxury `Header.tsx` (with mobile navigation drawer, delayed scroll reveal on first visit) and `Footer.tsx` (4-column layout with 28% advance guarantee), featuring the animated SVG compass rose & route from `BrandLogo.tsx`.
  * Universal Dynamic Package Detail: Single dynamic template `PackageDetailPage.tsx` driven by `TourPackage` props (`taj_mahal_sunrise_guided_tour.html`), supporting 1,000+ packages without static code explosion.
  * Curated Package Hub: `PackagesPage.tsx` (`packages.html`) with category tabs and decision matrix.
  * Universal 2-Step Booking Funnel: `BookingPage.tsx` (`step_1_taj_mahal_sunrise_guided_tour.html`, `step_2_booking_form_for_all.html`, `book_confirmed.html`) with 28% advance token and GST calculation.
  * Core Marketing & Corridor Hubs: `HomePage.tsx` with once-per-session `SmoothScrollHero`, point-to-point factual copy, 21st.dev motion bento cards, edge gradient fade masks on text roller, Taj Mahal sunrise imagery, and famous places gallery.
  * Services Page: `ServicesPage.tsx` retaining its clean original section layout, with unified font sizes, font colors, button sizes (`PrimaryButton`), and pure black WhatsApp button (`WhatsAppButton`).
  * Dynamic Templates: `RouteDetailPage.tsx` and `VehicleDetailPage.tsx` matching the new luxury design system and 2-step booking handoff.
  * Support & Compliance: `ContactPage.tsx` (`contact-us.html`), `FaqPage.tsx` (`faq.html`), `TermsPage.tsx` (`terms_condit.html`), `PrivacyPage.tsx` (`privacy_policy.html`), and `NotFoundPage.tsx` (`404.html`).
- **Verified:** Latest root `npm run verify` passed after the booking-flow changes (all app typechecks, backend tests, SEO lifecycle checks, and three builds); API-backed package fare/review flow and 390px mobile Step 1/2 layouts were also inspected.
- **Deployment monitoring (delivered with the integration branch):**
  `scripts/healthcheck.mjs` performs dependency-free checks of the API `/health`,
  the customer site and the admin site, wired to `.github/workflows/uptime.yml`
  (every 5 minutes, manual dispatch supported) and to `npm run healthcheck`, with
  `HEALTHCHECK_URLS` / `HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT_MS` / `HEALTHCHECK_ATTEMPTS` /
  `HEALTHCHECK_EXPECTED_STATUS` overrides. Delivered: uptime detection and the
  documented Render free-tier wake-up limitation. Still open in Phase I5: alert
  routing to a human (the workflow only fails), and request-ID correlation between
  the API and the frontends.
- **Open items:** Migration `0023_add_canonical_booking_selection.sql` is prepared but has not been applied to production; deploy it in the staged release before enabling the new persisted fields. Live payment credentials/webhook drills, placeholder NAP phone `+91 98765 43210`, real photography, human uptime alert routing, and the dev-only Vitest advisory remain launch work.

## Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Owner / next action |
|---|---|---|
| Client has not confirmed the real phone/WhatsApp number and final fare card | All CTAs and schema point at placeholder NAP | Client decision — `CLIENT_CONFIRMATION_FARES_AND_RULES.md` |
| Cloudflare Pages projects must be created/renamed to `skbagheltravels-customer` and `skbagheltravels-admin` and the domains repointed | Root deploy scripts and both `wrangler.jsonc` files now reference those names | Account owner (dashboard) |
| Render environment secrets are still `sync: false` placeholders | Production API cannot boot | Add values in the Render dashboard before the first API deploy |
| No live payment credentials / webhook drills | Booking remains advance-mock | Phase I2 |

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-14 | One repository, three independently deployable apps (`react/`, `admin/`, `backend/`), each with its own root directory, lockfile and build command | Hosts can deploy without coupling release cycles; no app is copied into a second repository |
| 2026-09-14 | Cloudflare Pages project names are `skbagheltravels-customer` and `skbagheltravels-admin`, used consistently by root scripts and every `wrangler.jsonc` | Provider-owned identifiers must be named once; a mismatch silently creates a second project |
| 2026-09-14 | Customer site keeps real 404 semantics (`404.html`, `not_found_handling: "404-page"`); admin uses an SPA fallback (`_redirects` + `single-page-application`) | Pre-rendered marketing URLs must return real 404s to crawlers; the admin is a client-routed panel that must survive refresh |
| 2026-09-14 | Builds write only inside `react/dist`, `admin/dist`, `backend/dist`; `generate-sitemap.ts` writes `react/dist` + the versioned `react/public` mirror and nothing else | A build must not dirty tracked files or write to the repository root; CI enforces it |
| 2026-09-14 | CI is the root command contract plus deploy guards, on Node 22 | One interface for CI, hosts and humans; Node 22 matches `engines`, Docker and Render |
| 2026-09-14 | Backend runtime image contains production dependencies only, with `.dockerignore` excluding `.env*` | Dev tooling never ships to production and secrets never enter the build context |
| 2026-09-14 | `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is documented and set in Pages as reserved configuration; no frontend code reads it until Phase I1 | Prevents a half-wired API integration from shipping silently |
| 2026-09-14 | Root docs are the monorepo of record (`README.md`, `02_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `03_PHASE_PLAN.md`, `04_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`, `PRD.md`); `react/docs/` keeps the frontend-specific pack and points at the root for shared docs | Removes two divergent copies of the same document |
| 2026-09-11 | Design Lock Registry (`DESIGN_LOCKS.md`): locked components/patterns cannot change without explicit user permission | Prevents silent drift of approved design work |
| 2026-09-10 | Legacy static HTML/CSS/JS/Python SSG codebase removed from the repository root; references preserved under `react/reference/` | One active frontend instead of a maintained and an unmaintained copy |
| 2026-09-10 | React workspace consolidated under `react/` with catalogue-driven route generation | The React app became the only customer frontend |
| 2026-09-09 | React migration ran beside the vanilla site, not as an in-place rewrite | Kept a working production baseline during the migration |
| 2026-09-07 | Payments spec (`docs/PAYMENT_SYSTEM.md`) with webhook + server-computed fare as the only source of payment truth; Razorpay primary, provider-neutral adapters | Real money requires webhook-confirmed state, never client confirmation |
| 2026-09-06 | Animation governance (`ANIMATION_RULES.md`) as a mandatory pre-implementation gate | Content first, motion second, accessibility always |
| 2026-09-03 | `PRD.md` is the master product-requirements document (goals, SEO/AISO strategy, design, engineering, QA gates) | One source of truth for "what we want" |
| 2026-09-01 | Bilingual URLs `/en/…` + `/hi/…`, English home at `/`, fares identical in both languages | Bilingual SEO without duplicating commercial data |
| 2026-09-01 | Call + WhatsApp are the primary conversions; `/book.html` is `noindex` | Phone/WhatsApp close this market; booking is secondary |
| 2026-09-01 | Dark Navy + Golden design system (`DESIGN.md`, `design-guide/`) is locked | Approved brand direction |
| 2026-10-02 | The browser holds no LocationIQ token: live location search runs only through the backend proxy (`/api/v1/locations/autocomplete`); the direct `api.locationiq.com` browser fallback, the `VITE_LOCATIONIQ_ACCESS_TOKEN` build-time read and the `window.LOCATIONIQ_ACCESS_TOKEN` global were removed from `react/src/hooks/useLocationIQ.ts`, `react/src/components/search/LocationCombobox.tsx` and `react/src/config.ts` | Frontend bundles are public, so any token shipped to the browser is exposed; the status badge now reports real proxy availability (`liveSearchAvailable`) instead of token presence |

---

## Session Log (condensed)

| Date | Era / phase | What was delivered |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-01 | Phases 1–11 | Static bilingual marketing site: design tokens, mock catalogue, fare engine, shared chrome, 5-step booking, WebP asset pipeline, EN/HI SSG with hreflang and lead bars, responsive QA |
| 2026-09-03 | Docs | Consolidated `PRD.md` (v3.0 master): business goals, SEO/AI-search strategy, engineering, design, QA gates |

| 2026-09-13 | Backend | Fare engine, draft bookings, Razorpay/HMAC payment adapters, admin dispatch, catalog, reviews, inquiries, notifications, migrations, 38-test deterministic suite |
| 2026-09-14 | Deployment monitoring | `scripts/healthcheck.mjs`, `.github/workflows/uptime.yml` (5-minute schedule), `npm run healthcheck`, step-by-step Render + Cloudflare Pages deploy guide in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| 2026-09-27 | Section 11 SEO lifecycle step | Live catalog structured data now omits invalid current offers for unavailable items, marks limited inventory with `LimitedAvailability`, exposes a last-reviewed freshness signal, and renders breadcrumb JSON-LD; sitemap generation no longer invents build-date `lastmod` values. Added `react/scripts/test-seo-lifecycle.ts` and committed main-push verification reports via `.github/workflows/main-monitor.yml` under `monitor-reports/`. |
| 2026-09-14 | Phase D1 | Deployment standardization: CI contract + guards, admin SPA routing, build-hygiene fix, Docker hardening, Pages project naming, doc pack rewritten (this file included) |
| 2026-09-25 | Phase M (M0–M2) | Master migration plan (`react/docs/MIGRATION_PLAN.md`), Tailwind CSS v4 setup, design tokens (`theme.css`), brand logo, luxury header with mobile nav sheet, footer with 28% advance guarantee, English-only mandate refactor |
| 2026-09-25 | Phase M (M3) | Universal dynamic tour package template (`PackageDetailPage.tsx`) powered by `TourPackage` props (`taj_mahal_sunrise_guided_tour.html`), curated package catalogue (`PackagesPage.tsx` from `packages.html`) with interactive category tabs and decision matrix |
| 2026-09-25 | Phase M (M4) | Streamlined 2-step universal booking funnel & transit voucher in `BookingPage.tsx` (`step_1_taj_mahal_sunrise_guided_tour.html`, `step_2_booking_form_for_all.html`, `book_confirmed.html`) wired to 28% advance token and GST calculation |
| 2026-09-25 | Phase M (M5) | Rebuilt all core marketing & support pages from `react/new_design/` (`HomePage.tsx`, `FleetPage.tsx`, `RoutesPage.tsx`, `ServicesPage.tsx`, `ContactPage.tsx`, `FaqPage.tsx`, `TermsPage.tsx`, `PrivacyPage.tsx`, `NotFoundPage.tsx`) under the English-only mandate |
| 2026-09-25 | Phase M (M6) | Full migration completion: converted dynamic templates (`AboutPage.tsx` from `services_why_choose_us.html`, `RouteDetailPage.tsx`, `VehicleDetailPage.tsx`) into the luxury design system; typecheck clean (0 errors), SSG pre-rendered 37 pages + 10 redirects + sitemap (32 URLs), and monorepo `npm run verify` passed 100% |
| 2026-09-25 | Phase M (M7–M8) | Master frontend standard: canonical `FRONTEND_RULES.md` created; oversized headlines globally scaled down to luxury editorial (Hero H1 26px, Section H2 20px); replaced legacy static reviews grid in `HomePage.tsx` with dual infinite `ReviewsMarquee` marquee (LOCK-N06); normalized oversized price displays in `FleetPage.tsx` and `ServicesPage.tsx`; removed stale unused `reviews` import; all DESIGN_LOCKS.md entries updated; `npm run verify` passed cleanly (3 typechecks, 55 backend tests, 3 builds) |
| 2026-09-25 | Phase M (M9) | Prestige Homepage Enhancements: added `InitialLoader.tsx` with 0-100% counter on pure white background with black capital `LOADING` typography; integrated `SmoothScrollHero` with Unsplash mobile photo `dCjcGh38WAc` by Shifan Hassan (*"A plane flying over Taj Mahal"*); implemented delayed navigation bar reveal in `Header.tsx` appearing only after scrolling past the hero image; lightened heavy button themes with brand terracotta and crisp `text-white` contrast; scroll-triggered reveals across sections preserving 100% SEO/AEO/GEO pre-rendering; monorepo `npm run verify` passed (3 typechecks, 55 backend tests, 3 production builds) |
| 2026-09-26 | Phase M (M15) | Master Editorial Typography & Button System: Updated `react/src/components/layout/EditorialPageTemplate.tsx` to provide strictly standardized font sizes, font colors (`EDITORIAL_TYPOGRAPHY`), button sizes, and button colors (`EDITORIAL_BUTTONS`) with reusable action components (`PrimaryButton`, `WhatsAppButton` with guaranteed pure white `#ffffff` text & icon, `SecondaryButton`, `EditorialPill`); updated `ServicesPage.tsx` preserving its clean original layout and sections while adopting uniform font sizes, font colors, and button sizes/colors throughout; monorepo `npm run verify` passed cleanly (3 typechecks, 55 backend tests, 3 builds) |
| 2026-10-01 | Task 6 continuation | Added the supplied Google Tag Manager container `GTM-KFXGSK7H` to `react/index.html` in both the document head and body noscript fallback, and updated `react/scripts/prerender.ts` so the noscript iframe survives every static SEO page; code-side SEO implementation remains complete, while external Search Console, GA/GTM workspace configuration, GBP, directory and backlink actions remain launch-owner work. |
| 2026-10-02 | PageSpeed Phase 1+2 + main integration (`feat/pagespeed-booking-seo-hub`) | Canonical 5-fleet registry (`react/src/data/fleets.ts`) feeding both booking widgets, manifest builder and pre-renderer with Hatchback/contrast/Unsplash build guards; typed SVG icon registry (`react/src/components/icons/Icon.tsx`) replacing Material Symbols font spans (font subsetting via fontTools breaks `rlig` ligatures — do not retry; migrate call-sites to `<Icon>` instead); Famous Places gallery moved from Unsplash to self-hosted AVIF/WebP/JPG responsive sets under `react/public/assets/places/gallery/`; LCP hero as `<picture>` AVIF/WebP; GTM deferred to idle; merged latest `main` (published-catalog SSG prerender + SEO remediation docs) resolving the `prerender.ts` import conflict as a union of both sides; removed the browser-direct LocationIQ fallback (proxy-only search); fixed `RouteDetailPage` corridor visual pointing at three non-existent `/assets/routes/*.webp` files (now the existing `/assets/hero/hero-highway.webp`). Root `npm run verify` green: 3 typechecks, backend tests, SEO lifecycle, 3 builds; pre-render 49 pages + 14 redirects, sitemap 39 URLs. Not deployed. |
| 2026-10-04 | Canonical booking-selection integrity fix (`fix/canonical-booking-selection`) | Removed the duplicate trip-selection stage and carried one typed selection through fare quote, review, booking intent/finalization, owned history and voucher; added additive migration `0023`, profile prefill/current-profile endpoint, customer/admin type-specific labels, and end-to-end tests. Root `npm run verify` passed; 390px mobile Step 1/2 and API-backed package fare/review were inspected. Production database was not modified; migration rollout remains pending. |
