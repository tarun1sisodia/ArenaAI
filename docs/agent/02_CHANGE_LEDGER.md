# ArenaAI Agent Change Ledger

## 2026-09-27

### Catalog test-price allowance

The admin catalog starting-fare input now accepts values from ₹1. The backend already accepted positive values. This is for Razorpay Test Mode/catalog-flow testing only; it does not bypass server-authoritative fare calculation, payment verification, or production payment-provider safeguards.

### `0d6bd95` — SEO/AEO/GEO lifecycle governance

Merged into the root operating specification:

- Draft/published/paused/archived/retired lifecycle
- Stable URL preservation
- Archive without losing SEO value
- Sitemap and canonical rules
- AEO answer and structured-data rules
- GEO/entity consistency rules
- Lifecycle acceptance tests

### Phase 1 — Step 1.1: Production Payment Provider Enforcement & Client Checkout Modal

Implemented:

- Mandatory Razorpay credentials (`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) enforced in `backend/src/config/env.ts` when `NODE_ENV === "production"`.
- Test/dummy credentials (`rzp_test_local*`) strictly prohibited in production.
- `createRazorpayAdapter` in `backend/src/providers/adapters/razorpay.ts` throws immediately if HMAC fallback is attempted with `isProduction: true`.
- Created comprehensive unit test suite in `backend/tests/unit/payment-provider-production.test.ts` (5 tests passing).
- Created `react/src/features/booking/razorpay.ts` with dynamic script loader (`https://checkout.razorpay.com/v1/checkout.js`) and TypeScript definitions.
- Wired official Razorpay Standard Checkout modal in `react/src/features/booking/BookingPage.tsx` (`handleSubmitBooking`).
- Transition to Confirmed Voucher Step 4 is gated on verified modal `handler` callback or server verification.
- Verified with full `npm run verify` (typecheck x3, backend test suites, build x3).

### Phase 1 — Step 1.2: Public Media Visibility Enforcement (SEC-004)

Implemented:

- Enforced public visibility rule in `backend/src/modules/catalog/catalog.service.ts`: `getMediaContent` verifies that both the media record itself and its parent catalog item have `status === "published"` before serving bytes to anonymous callers.
- Updated `backend/src/modules/catalog/catalog.controller.ts`: Anonymous requests for unpublished/draft/archived media return HTTP 404 (`MEDIA_NOT_FOUND`). Authenticated staff/admin requests can preview draft media with `private, no-cache, no-store` headers. Published media receives `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.
- Added migration `backend/migrations/0019_enforce_media_visibility_rls.sql` to restrict PostgREST anonymous SELECT to only published media of published items.
- Created test suite `backend/tests/unit/media-visibility.test.ts` (3 tests passing) and updated `backend/tests/integration/catalog-live.test.ts`.
- Full `npm run verify` passed with 15 test suites, 100 tests, and all builds green.

## Current webhook route

```text
https://client-juj4.onrender.com/api/v1/payments/webhooks/razorpay
```

The Razorpay webhook secret must exactly matches Render's `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Never store the secret here.

## Current verification baseline

- React typecheck/build passed after live-flow safety changes.
- Admin typecheck/build passed after auth hardening.
- Backend typecheck/build passed.
- Focused backend network-header and catalog-manifest tests passed.

## Known next work

See `docs/agent/00_CONTEXT_HANDOFF.md` and section 8 of the root operating specification. The most important engineering task is making database fare rules and catalog routes the single production source used by public fare calculation and booking.
