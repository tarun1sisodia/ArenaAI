## Operating Protocol for AI Agents

1. **Mandatory Pre-Edit Gate:**
   - **Before modifying, refactoring, restyling, or deleting ANY existing file, component, CSS class, or pattern, the AI MUST consult this document.**
2. **Strict Rule for `LOCKED` Items:**
   - **If a component, pattern, or file is marked `LOCKED`:**
     - **DO NOT TOUCH, EDIT, REFACTOR, OR RE-THEME IT AUTOMATICALLY.**
     - **YOU MUST STOP AND ASK THE USER FIRST.**
     - Explicit prompt format:
       > *"The component `<ComponentName />` (or style/pattern) is currently marked as **LOCKED** in `DESIGN_LOCKS.md`. Would you like to unlock it or approve this specific modification?"*
   - Only proceed with modifying a locked component if the user explicitly confirms or requests changes to it.
3. **Behavior for `UNLOCKED` / New Features:**
   - If an item is `UNLOCKED` or not listed, proceed according to `03_PHASE_PLAN.md` and `REACT-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` as normal.
4. **Registering New Locks:**
   - Whenever the user says *"Lock this design"*, *"Make this permanent"*, *"Keep this pattern"*, or approves a component/feature as final, immediately add it to the **Active Locks Registry** below with its exact file paths, critical classes, visual tokens, and date.

## How to Request an Unlock or Modification

If a future phase task (e.g. backend wiring, marketing detail template, internationalization) appears to require changes to a locked item:
1. **Stop immediately before editing the code.**
2. **Present the proposed change to the user:**
   - Explain *what* needs to change.
   - Explain *why* the change is requested.
   - Show the exact proposed diff or preview.
3. **Wait for explicit user approval:**
   - If the user approves: update `DESIGN_LOCKS.md` with the new revision and proceed.
   - If the user declines: preserve the locked design intact and find an alternative non-destructive implementation.

## Amendment Log

### 2026-09-15 — Additive CSS completion (no locked design altered)

A frontend repair pass added `react/src/styles/ui-kit.css` and converted six
bare `<div>` page roots into `<main id="main-content">`. This was **purely
additive**: 17 undefined CSS custom properties were declared as aliases of the
locked LOCK-010 tokens, 87 undefined class names received their missing rules
(`.container`, `.page-hero*`, `.cta-banner-*`, `.faq-accordion-*`,
`.button-gold/secondary/block`, icon size contracts, …), and the 44–76px
campaign `h1` scale was **scoped to `.home-hero h1`** instead of applying to
every page.

Nothing in this pass re-themes, re-lays-out or restructures any locked
component. Specifically:

- `LOCK-001 … LOCK-009` — markup and class names untouched; only previously
  undefined helper classes used by their markup (`.container`, `.icon-call`,
  `.icon-wa`, `.sun`, `.moon`, `.section--paper*`, `.brand-compass-icon`,
  `.cinematic-puck-icon`, `.roll-label`, `.footer-col`) received definitions.
- `LOCK-010` — `tokens.css` and `DESIGN.md` were **not modified**. The new
  alias layer points at the locked values (`--primary: var(--gold)`,
  `--font-heading: var(--font-display)`, `--text-dim: var(--text-soft)`, …).
- `LOCK-011` — chrome components were not restructured; the new rules only
  size the icon spans and footer columns their existing markup already used.

Future edits to locked components still require the unlock protocol above.
See `react/docs/07_UI_REPAIR_REPORT.md` for the full root-cause analysis.
